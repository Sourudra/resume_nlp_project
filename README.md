This project is a Streamlit application that allows users to upload a resume (in PDF format) and input a job description to check the match between the skills listed in both. The application extracts skills from both the resume and job description, cleans the text, and then compares them using BERT-based semantic similarity. The matching score and skill matches are visualized using a pie chart.
